# A machine model that predicts the number of humans in the world
This project uses libraries such as: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
The first step was to analyze the data. The data used comes from kaggle [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmethoso/wpp-population-by-age-and-sex) 
with a dataset of 66.893 rows and 71 columns containing data on the growth of populations of every country, continent and organization that exists. 
The data are categorized between the different age groups from 0 to 100 years and over and the sex of each population, from the years 1950 to 2100.
